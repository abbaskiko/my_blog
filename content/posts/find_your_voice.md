You have been a pretty good engineer, and now you try your hand at being an engineering manager.[^1] But, maybe you find find it difficult adjusting to your new role, knowing how and when to exert more assertive leadership with direct reports who were formerly peers as well as with leads and managers of other teams.

I've recently been coaching such a manager on exactly this issue. This new manager commands much respect not just among his teammates but across the company at large.  However, he's naturally rather quiet and has not previously had a manager who modelled the desired behavior.  He is much more comfortable in a one on one situation helping and advising, but has been reluctant to step up when team members are working on the wrong things or not making progress.  And, in design meetings with other teams he sits quietly without contributing.

While the results of my coaching remain to be seen, i wanted to share the advice I've given, and welcome comments and suggestions from others.




One difficulty some engineers face when they become managers is finding their voice.  They may be reluctant to assert themselves in various contexts where their voice is needed.  For example, in some design discussions among their team sometimes they need to steer the conversation back on track.  Or, in design discussions involving other teams, too, the manager needs to represent her team's perspective to help ensure a good collective decision.  In daily standups, sometimes an engineer's update will suggest they are not making much progress and the manager should find a way to help.  Sometimes, an engineer will just behave inappropriately (perhaps inadvertently), warranting the manager having some discussion with that engineer.  (Whether this feedback should come immediately, possibly in a public meeting, or soon after in 1:1 conversation should be decided on a case by case basis.)

Several factors may be at play here:

1. Personality - it's not unusual for engineers to be a bit on the quiet side.
2. Discomfort now being the boss of people who were formerly peers.
3. Fear of being wrong as the "manager".


[^1]: I don't think of this as a promotion.  Instead, I think it's just a different track.
