I sometimes tease a colleague of mine for repeatedly asking "What problem are we trying to solve?".  I tease him not because it's a bad question;  it's most definitely not!  I tease him because the question arises so often - and I like to tease him.

Consider the following examples of recommendations engineers might make:
1.  We should move our platform to Kubernetes.
2.  We should use Kafka as an ESB (enterprise service bus).
3.  We should split \__<fill in the blank>\__ into a separate service.
