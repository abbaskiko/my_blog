I've been leading software engineering teams since 2001.  Prior to that, as an individual contributor I couldn't stop thinking about how the team could be better managed, making it inevitable I would go into management to try to do it better.

Fundamentally I believe software development works best as a team sport, which makes good leadership essential.  That leadership is needed to ensure folks collaborate effectively as a team.

I have many strong opinions on engineering, leadership and management.  While strong opinions, they are not necessarily strongly held.  I like to have my views challenged and believe I'm willing to evolve when faced with a convincing argument.  I hope this blog will help me learn and refine my views through the process of writing and engaging with others' having different perspectives.
