content: "Yeah, networking is where a lot of Kubernetes' complexity lies, which lends to some of the nastier bugs. The CNI architecture, multiple network plugins (Flannel, Weave, Calico...) with different approaches and trade-offs which make the decision complex.\r\n\r\nAlso, choosing a \"Kubernetes as a service\" provider may be fine for some companies, and I'm sure that at least gCloud solves a lot for you. But some companies can't just do that for business reasons, and they have to fight all the installing, running and upgrading complexities by themselves."
